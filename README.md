# slp-aide

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.0.

This project will look like these Adobe XD mockups when complete:

iOS: https://xd.adobe.com/view/1b77f3da-c8fc-442a-40d0-f34988827b92-6d46/

Android: https://xd.adobe.com/view/8734dea7-09b5-40b7-56b0-bc4de840c582-f105/

## Development server

Web: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

iOS: Run `tns run ios`. The app will appear in your Xcode simulator.

Android: Run `tns run android`. The app will appear in your Android Studio simulator.

Alternatively, download the NativeScript Preview and Playground apps. Run `tns preview` and then use the NativeScript Playground app on your device to scan the QR code generated. This will open the slp-aide in your NativeScript Preview app.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
